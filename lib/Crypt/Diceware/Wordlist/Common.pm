=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Crypt::Diceware 'words'; # Common is the default
  use Crypt::Diceware words => { wordlist => 'Common' };

  my @phrase = words(4);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An English language word list based on lists of common English words.
Compared to the Original and Beale wordlists, this list has some longer words,
but no nonsense words ("fs", "ga", "rrrr"), so everything on this list
should be familiar to a reasonable well-read 

The words were assembled from various free lists or sample lists of the most
common English words available at
L<freevocabulary.com|http://www.freevocabulary.com> and
L<wordfrequency.info|http://www.wordfrequency.info>.  It is heavily weighted
towards the first five thousand or so common words, sprinkled with samples
from the 100,000 most common words.

All words are between three and nine letters.  Some common profanity words have
been removed.  All words are lower case.  (Any trademark names or offensive
words included are an oversight.)
